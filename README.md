### Yocket College Finder-Masters Automation Assignment

The purpose of this project is to create an automation flow for shortlisting a Masters College on Yocket and I have built a Page Object Model Framework for the same. 
I've included test cases bases on valid and invalid (including edge cases) test data for my testing. 

I have selected below tool stack to work for this assignment:

- Language: Java(v 1.8)
- Test Engine: TestNG

I have created this project with few things in consideration:

1. Scalability
2. Maintenance
3. Reusability
